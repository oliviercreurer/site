        <h3 class="p-headline">As part of Whereabouts, our suite of apps built for tourism destinations big and small, Booker plays a major role. It’s a simple, intuitive booking engine that puts a ton of power in the hands of independent tourism businesses, giving them the ability to control their e-commerce strategy without having to rely solely on high-fee, corporate aggregators like Airbnb and Booking.com to capture bookings.</h3>
        <p>Many small, independent tourism businesses are often reticent to embrace new tech solutions — and with good reason. They’re bloated, complex, and end up taking time away from doing what they love most: actually running a tourism businesses on a day-to-day basis. Booker’s goal, besides being a powerful conversion engine, is to give these businesses time back in their day.</p>

The app itself was written in Lua, but the fun really started when it came time to coding and designing a multi-page interface using only a 128x64 pixel display, 3 buttons, and 3 encoders.</h3>
