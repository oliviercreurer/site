          <h3 class="p-headline">Booker is a light-weight, low-fee booking engine that we’ve built directly into our larger app for tourism destinations, Whereabouts. Booker’s focus is to provide small, independent tourism businesses — many of which have limited to no digital presence — with an e-commerce solution that’s designed precisely for their unique needs while being easy to embed anywhere on the web. </h3>
        </div>
        <p>Many of the businesses we support are reticent to adopt modern tech tools — and for good reason. Big corporate aggregators like Airbnb and Booking.com take huge cuts of their profits, and smaller platforms more tailored to tourism products are often bogged down by endless complexity.</p>
        <p>Having relied almost exclusively on government funding, our journey to the current version of Booker has been rewarding but not without its challenges. Through a handful of iterations, various rounds of beta testing, and many conversations with small businesses, we’ve honed the product to a point where we feel it delivers a simple experience while being modular enough to support long-term development. </p>
        <script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/ydqyvuvcn3.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:88% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_ydqyvuvcn3 seo=false videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%">&nbsp;</div></div></div>
        <p>Booker went through a few iterations since 2020, and each one was informed by extensive user interviews, feedback, and beta testing. We used all of this user data to continually refine and simplify the Booker product; given how short on time these tourism businesses are, it’s important that we build software that solves real-world problems for them — and quickly.</p>
        <p>Booker is made up of two parts: one is the consumer-facing embed through which reservations are made, and the other is the admin app for businesses through which they manage their calendar, configure settings, and create sellable products. For this case study, I’ll focus on the latter.</p>
        <p>Tourism businesses here in Canada are funky — in a good way. A single business might offer everything from accommodations, meal plans, guided tours, classes, and even chartered flights to their remote location. Though we want to support multi-product Bookers with complex dependencies in the long run, we needed to start with a model that would be easy to build and dead-simple for businesses to adopt.</p>
        <p>In the current version, businesses create sellable products — either accommodations, events, or fee-based products — in their Booker Admin app, and each one gets its own embeddable Booker instance. The data model we’ve created for these sellable products is simple, such that a business owner can create a product and get it online with minutes.</p>
        <img class="img-shadow"src="images/product-root.png" alt="">
        <p>↑ In the Booker Admin app, business owners can see an overview of their sellable products. From here, they can also create new ones, as shown in the screens below.</p>
        <img class="img-shadow"src="images/product-info.png" alt="">
        <p>In this example, we're looking at the creation flow for an accommodation product. The flow is broken down into clear steps, and at each one, the user can see a live preview of their Booker being rendered on the right-hand side.</p>

          <h3 class="p-headline">Compass is audio sampling software that I wrote for an open-source sound computer called norns. The app itself was written in Lua, but the fun really started when it came time to coding and designing a multi-page interface using only a 128x64 pixel display, 3 buttons, and 3 encoders.</h3>
        </div>
        <img src="images/compass01.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>Compass, at its core, is an audio looper, but with a twist: it's driven by a sequencer, and for each step in the sequence, you can select various commands that manipulate and mangle the incoming audio in all sorts of creative and unpredictable ways — speeding it up or slowing it down, reversing playback, jumping to different points in the audio stream, changing the speed of the sequencer itself...</p>
        <p>Key for me was creating a user interface — using very limited inputs! — that would be intuitive, fast, and encourage happy accidents. One of the breakthroughs I had while developing the UI was settling on the idea to include basic documentation in the app itself, providing users with a mini-manual of sorts they have access to without ever having to stop making music.</p>

        <p class="">Many small, independent tourism businesses are often reticent to embrace new tech solutions — and with good reason. They’re bloated, complex, and end up taking time away from doing what they love most: actually running a tourism businesses on a day-to-day basis. Booker’s goal, besides being a powerful conversion engine, is to give these businesses time back in their day.</p>
