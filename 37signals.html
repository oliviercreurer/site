                My name is Olivier Creurer, and I’m thrilled to be submitting my candidacy for the
                role of Product Designer at 37signals. I’ve spent the last ten years working in
                software, though not all of them were devoted to design; I’ve helped craft
                exceptional customer experiences in both support and management roles as well, and I
                strongly believe this diversity in my skills and knowledge would make me a highly
                unique addition to the 37signals team.

                showcase one of my recent design projects. You can find the rest of my portfolio

            <h4>A bit about me...</h4>
            <p>
                My journey to product design began in 2014, when I joined Wistia as a relatively
                early employee. As with all start-ups, there was no shortage of hats to wear and the
                opportunities were plenty. On the Customer Happiness team, I didn’t just crunch
                through tickets — I learned HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and just enough Ruby to
                be dangerous; I wrote public-facing documentation and directed quirky help videos;
                and I assisted in hiring and training new staff. Combined, these efforts helped me
                transition to management, where I spent the next three years fostering and scaling
                the Customer Happiness team. I first learned the ropes as a people manager, then did
                a stint as Interim Director of the team before finally leading a small crew of
                Support Engineers. From the vantage point of support, I gained an invaluable
                perspective on software development that helped me transition to Product Design and
                which still informs my work to this day. In my last two years at the company, I
                helped design Soapbox, Wistia’s first video recording product, and served as the
                principal designer on the first version of the podcast audio player.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since 2022, I’ve served as Chief Product Officer for the Technology Tourism Co.
                (TTC). We’re dedicated to building simple, accessible software for the tourism
                industry, (with a focus on destination management organizations), and we’ve
                successfully internationalized our business, with clients across both Canada and the
                US. Revitalizing a sector that’s long been shackled to aging and bloated software is
                no small feat, but our products — built by a tiny but amazingly talented team — have
                really struck a chord with forward-thinking tourism destinations. As CPO and
                co-founder, I balance many responsibilities. When I’m not actively designing our
                products, I’m either doing user research, developing our design system, shaping our
                broader, long-term strategy with the rest of the executive team, or managing dev
                projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                Though I’m very grateful for all the opportunities I’ve had over the last decade,
                I’m ready for a new adventure. I want to face new creative and technical challenges.
                I want to experience new forms of collaboration. I want to expand my toolkit,
                develop new skills, and take new risks. Perhaps most importantly, I want to build
                meaningful, opinionated products on a personable scale — products that spark
                something in people.
            </p>

            <p>
                I obsess over the organizing principles of everything I come across. From the
                simplest piece of software to the most puzzling film, I’m drawn to all the ways in
                which a particular structure shapes my experience of something. But I’m not content
                in merely observing from the sidelines; I wouldn’t be a designer if I was.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m a product designer because I have a deep passion for building things. Because
                I’m driven to figure out exactly how something should <i>work</i> while never
                ignoring the way it should <strong>feel</strong>. Because I value the experience you
                get when form and function are in a special, almost indescribable kind of harmony.
            </p>

            <p>
                I spend most of my time building for the web, but I don’t believe in limiting my
                work and my interests to a single medium. When the broader world of tech feels like
                it’s racing towards the lowest of common denominators, I get my inspiration from
                watching and making films, developing music software, learning new technical skills,
                and crafting furniture. I believe that this kind of creative restlessness doesn’t
                detract from but rather informs and improves my professional work.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m also driven by constraints. I don’t have the luxury of a shop or expensive
                tools, so when I build a piece of furniture in my small apartment, I figure out how
                to do it with limited means (and little to no noise because I like my neighbours).
                When I developed Compass, a music app for an open-source sound computer, I spent
                countless hours puzzling through the best way to make an intuitive, enjoyable user
                interface with just three buttons, three encoders, and a 128x64 pixel display.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m a long-time admirer of 37signals. I’ve used Basecamp and Shape Up to organize my
                teams and Hey to organize my life, and I find your core product philosophy a beacon
                of inspiration in an industry that too often loves the comfort of conformity. My
                deep enthusiasm for what you do, however, doesn’t preclude critical thinking;
                there’s always room for improvement, and one of the main reasons I’m applying for
                this position is because I believe I share with you all a commitment to the
                relentless pursuit of simplicity. Given my skills, background, and interests, I
                strongly believe 37signals is the best place for me to take the next step in my
                career, and I’d be proud, as a Product Designer, to contribute to its ongoing
                success.
            </p>

            <h4>Recent Inspiration</h4>

            <p>
                This year, I decided that I'd submit my taxes early and not drag my feet like I
                usually do. But I drag my feet for a reason — compiling and submitting a tax return
                is typically a dreadful thing to do. This time was a breeze, though, because I used
                <a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/" target="_blank">Wealthsimple</a>, a
                start-up that's been revolutionizing banking and investing here in Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wealthsimple initially hooked me because it promised an easy entry-point to
                investing for total newcomers. The genius of the product is that it not only
                <i>immediately</i> delivered on its promise (I opened successful investment accounts
                in under 5 minutes), but quickly made clear that I could easily manage my day-to-day
                banking with them too. In under 48 hours, I have moved pretty much all of my assets
                from a big bank I loathed and haven't looked back since. And months later, when I
                discovered I could submit my taxes for free with them in about 20 minutes, I knew
                I'd made the right choice. Oh, and did I mention that the whole product experience
                lives in a beautifully designed mobile app?
            </p>
            <p>
                I find Wealthsimple to be an exceptional product. Its onboarding is highly
                successful, and it knows exactly when to lend a hand and when to stay out of the
                way. That's a tough balance to strike.
            </p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>On the more esoteric side of things, I've recently been fascinated with the history and practices of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene" target="_blank"">demoscene</a> subculture. In a world crumbling under excessive waste, it's refreshing to see what can be done with ridiculously small computer programs. If <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9jn6ExjDw8" target="_blank"">this</a> can be done on a computer with just 256 bytes, what else could we accomplish with this mindset?</p>
