            <h4>About</h4>
            <p class="p-large">
                My last project at Wistia as product designer was to design a new audio player to
                support the company's shift into podcasting. Our goal was to ship a powerful,
                embeddeable audio player with rich podcasting features — all without sacrificing the
                simplicity and elegance of Wistia's much-admired video player.

            </div>

            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p>
                One of the key challenges we faced as a product team working on the audio player was
                figuring out how to balance simplicity and density of content — all within a
                constrained UI and a limited amount of time. Compared to Wistia's video player, the
                new audio player would need to account for a major increase in metadata (show
                details, description, transcript, etc.) and new, audio-specific controls. Through
                near-daily working sessions with developers, I mapped out the layout of the player
                at different breakpoints and established how functionality would be introduced as
                the player grew in size.
