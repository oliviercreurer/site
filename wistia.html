            <h4>About</h4>
            <p class="p-large">
                My last project at Wistia as product designer was to design a
                new audio player to support the company's shift into podcasting.
                Our goal was to ship a powerful, embeddeable audio player with
                rich podcasting features — all without sacrificing the
                simplicity and elegance of Wistia's much-admired video player.
                Below is a video I recorded detailing its features and
                functionality.

            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p>
                Shortly after co-founding The Tourism Technology Co., a company
                dedicated to building lightweight and simple software for the
                tourism industry, my colleagues and I began work on Whereabouts,
                our flagship product. From its inception to its current
                iteration, I’ve served as Whereabouts’ Chief Product Officer,
                sole designer, researcher, and occasional people manager.
