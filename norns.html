            <h4>About</h4>
            <p class="p-large">
                Between 2018 and 2022, I developed three apps for <a target="_blank" href="https://monome.org/docs/norns/">norns</a>, an open-source sound computer. Written in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)">Lua</a>, these apps helped me learn the fundamentals of programming, and launching them publicly allowed me to take on other project management duties such as user testing, code maintainability, and documentation. With the support of a wonderful <a target="_blank" href="https://llllllll.co/">creative community</a>, my apps were adopted by hundreds of musicians around the world and found their way into a variety of musical projects.


            </p>

            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p>
                The development of these apps — while definitely challenging — presented so many learning opportunities. As a complete amateur (and solo) developer, it was a little hair-raising to see sudden and widespread adoption, but that helped me improve my code and design immeasurably. And with hundreds of people using my apps within a day or two of launch, I had to learn how to prioritize feature requests and, naturally, bug reports.

                but there's no better way to improve your code and design when what you've built is suddenly being used by hundreds of people.

                but the fun really started when it came time to coding and designing a multi-page interface using only a 128x64 pixel display, 3 buttons, and 3 encoders.
