            <h4>About</h4>
            <p class="p-large">
                Built for the modern Destination Management Organization (DMO),
                Whereabouts gives it the tools it needs to collaborate with
                stakeholders, ensure the integrity of its data, market its
                region, and drive conversions. Powering each and every
                Whereabouts instance is our proprietary, international database
                of tourism businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shortly after co-founding The Tourism Technology Co., a company
                dedicated to building lightweight and simple software for the
                tourism industry, my colleagues and I began work on Whereabouts,
                our flagship product. From its inception to its current
                iteration, I’ve served as Whereabouts’ Chief Product Officer,
                sole designer, researcher, and occasional people manager.

                <span class="caption"
                    >By leveraging our proprietary, international database, DMOs
                    can create a directory of tourism businesses and points of
                    interest that reflects its region.</span

            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p>
                The tourism space is one that’s still very much tied to outdated
                tech, and in the rare case of DMOs making the leap to a modern
                software stack, they too often end up buying needlessly
                complicated CRMs that were never designed to meet their unique
                needs. Instead of using a tool to support their efforts, DMOs
                get caught in the trap of supporting a tool that’ll never quite
                work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite that roadblock, DMOs do become accustomed to feature
                bloat and come to expect parity when evaluating new tools.
                Whereabouts, though, will never be a rival to HubSpot or
                Salesforce — in fact, we distinguish ourselves by stating that
                we’re not a CRM. Our product challenge — our task — is to
                convince DMOs that having hundreds of levers to pull won’t
                necessarily solve their problems. Whereabouts, as a result,
                needs to make an immediate impression and its features need to
                feel essential and intuitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of my day-to-day, there's been no shortage of
                challenges. Naturally, as in any startup, I've been wearing many
                hats: as co-founder, I'm heavily involved in strategic,
                financial, and HR efforts; as Chief Product Officer, I'm tasked
                with setting and maintaining the product experience; and,
                finally, as the sole designer working with four full-time
                developers, I've had to work at an incredibly fast pace to keep
                everything on track. Despite all this, we managed to
                successfully execute a complete rebuild of the app in a single
                quarter and have secured multiple new contracts as a result.
