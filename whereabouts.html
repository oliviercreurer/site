            <p class="p-large">
                Built for the modern Destination Management Organization (DMO), Whereabouts gives it
                the tools it needs to collaborate with stakeholders, ensure the integrity of its
                data, market its region, and drive conversions. Powering each and every Whereabouts
                instance is our proprietary, international database of tourism businesses.

                Shortly after co-founding The Tourism Technology Co., a company dedicated to
                building lightweight and simple software for the tourism industry, my colleagues and
                I began work on Whereabouts, our flagship product. From its inception to its current
                iteration, I’ve served as Whereabouts’ Chief Product Officer, sole designer,
                researcher, and occasional people manager.
