            <h4>About</h4>
            <p class="p-large">
                Shortly after co-founding The Tourism Technology Co. (TTC), a company dedicated to building lightweight and simple software for the tourism industry, my colleagues and I began work on Whereabouts, our flagship product. From its inception to its current iteration, I’ve served as Whereabouts’ Chief Product Officer, sole designer, researcher, and occasional people manager.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whereabouts is software built for the modern Destination Management Organization (DMO) — one that's tired of managing its entire tourism region through, at best, an ill-suited CRM, or, at worst, a disorganized spreadsheet. Powered by a proprietary database of tourism businesses, each Whereabouts instance gives a DMO the tools it needs to collaborate with stakeholders, ensure the integrity of its data, market its region, and drive conversions. Behind the consumer-facing UI is a powerful API that can serve as a backend to power tourism webites.
            </p>

                <img class="img-inline" src="images/wa-2.png" />
                <span class="caption"
                    >By leveraging our proprietary, international database, DMOs
                    can create a directory of tourism businesses and points of
                    interest that reflects its region.</span
                >
            </div>

            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p>
                The tourism space is one that’s still very much tied to outdated
                tech, and in the rare case of DMOs making the leap to a modern
                software stack, they too often end up buying needlessly
                complicated CRMs that were never designed to meet their unique
                needs. Instead of using a tool to support their efforts, DMOs
                get caught in the trap of supporting a tool that’ll never quite
                work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite that roadblock, DMOs do become accustomed to feature
                bloat and come to expect parity when evaluating new tools.
                Whereabouts, though, will never be a rival to HubSpot or
                Salesforce — in fact, we distinguish ourselves by stating that
                we’re not a CRM. Our product challenge — our task — is to
                convince DMOs that having hundreds of levers to pull won’t
                necessarily solve their problems. Whereabouts, as a result,
                needs to make an immediate impression and its features need to
                feel essential and intuitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of my day-to-day, there's been no shortage of
                challenges. Naturally, as in any startup, I've been wearing many
                hats: as co-founder, I'm heavily involved in strategic,
                financial, and HR efforts; as Chief Product Officer, I'm tasked
                with setting and maintaining the product experience; and,
                finally, as the sole designer working with four full-time
                developers, I've had to work at an incredibly fast pace to keep
                everything on track. Despite all this, we managed to
                successfully execute a complete rebuild of the app in a single
                quarter and have secured multiple new contracts as a result.

            <h4>Favorite Part</h4>
            <p>
                Our sister company, <a href="https://thenew.business" target="_blank"">The New Business</a>, has been focused on tourism-related marketing for the last decade, and it's a fount of knowledge and research. Having now ventured into product solutions, TTC is equipped with invaluable insights that would have otherwise taken years to acquire. Being tapped into a market in that way is a real blessing for such a young company.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's also great fun working on a product that feels immediately refreshing and exciting to its intended users — a breath of fresh air after, in many cases, years if not decades of struggling in the digital space. That kind of optimism and support has really encouraged our small but extraordinary team, driving everyone towards creative solutions that I've been super proud of having contributed to.
